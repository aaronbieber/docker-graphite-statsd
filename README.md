# Graphite StatsD Docker Configuration

This is my Docker Compose configuration for `hopsoft/graphite-statsd`, which is
basically just a backup of the thing I run. When run the first time, the "data"
directory will be created alongside the `docker-compose.yml` and that is where
your whisper DB data will be written.
